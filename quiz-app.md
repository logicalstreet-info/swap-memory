# Quiz app
 - We need to create a test for students of an online academy. We have a database of questions with four possible answers, in which only one is correct.
  - Students will do a randomised test of 5 questions (that are already created inside each subject). Those questions need to be from the subjects that the student has already completed.

 - The test will show the 5 questions, and after all of them are replied, it will give the total result (mark) plus the percentage of correct answers, plus the correct answer of the question in green + your answer in grey if its wrong (see file attached).

- We have to keep the percentage of correct answers that the student has made, and the number of tests that the student has already finished.
